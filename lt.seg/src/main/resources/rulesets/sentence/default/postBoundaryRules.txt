# Define positive or negative regex rules for tokens after a sentence boundary. The boundary itself is not part of the token.
# 
# A positive rule has the form '+ <regex>', a negative rule has the form '- <regex>'.  
#

#
# small letter after boundary -> no sentence
- [a-z][a-zA-Z]*[\.!?]?

##
# if followed by more sentence boundary characters -> no sentence
- [\.!?,;:]+
